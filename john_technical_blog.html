   				<span>Uncrate</span> is one of my favorite sites because it's a blog about some of the latest, greatest, and most ridiculous gadgets a guy could want. Uncrate updates you on things ranging from bacon beer, electronics, the latest Aston Martin you can buy, shoes, and the latest fashion trend for men. I would describe the content on Uncrate as elegant, impractical, modern, ridiculous, and fun. 
   				<br/>
   				<br/>
    			When you first visit Uncrate.com you notice a large image of the latest item they are feature on their blog. This instantly grabs your interests and makes you want to scroll down to read the description of the item. When you scroll down Uncrate has smaller images of previous items they have feature to fit more on the page when you scroll down - possibly to hook to stay on the page. 
    			<br/>
   				<br/>
    			I would describe Uncrate.com as simple, modern, clean, elegant, and easy to navigate. If there's a particular category of items you are interested in, Uncrate lists links to specific categories such as gear, cars, style, tech, body, food, and vices at the top of their page. I believe that navigating through all the content is simple since images of the items are nice and big and the words are easy to read. Uncrate does a good job is also ensuring that you can click on the image or a link to the original’s product's website to purchase. 
    			<br/>
   				<br/>
    			I honestly fee like I've wasted a lot of time browsing through the site of many items I personally have never purchased anything through uncrate - then again I'm not loaded with money. However I love looking at a lot of the innovation and creative creations that people are building in the various fields of interests Uncrate covered. Overall feeling I feel pretty excited and happy to see all these interested and innovated creations created by people.

				<span>Hypem</span> is one of my favorite ways to discover new music and remixes of my favorite songs. Hypem is sort of a special place where DJs add their own twists to popular songs and users can up vote or down vote if they like the song. 
				<br/>
   				<br/>
				When you visit Hypem you are initially down to the list of songs they are featuring and advertisements on the right side of the page. The list of the songs are the most important parts of the website. I would describe the website as a little simple, light, and basic. Hypem connects music producers to an audience of people that are looking explore a variety of music. Everyday thousands of people around the world write music and upload them to Hypem for others to share and discover. I would describe the content as fun, interesting, exciting, and addicting. It can be addicting because its fun to search your favorite songs and listen to all the various remixes or variations of your favorite song. 
				<br/>
   				<br/>
				I believe Hypem can be a little confusing to navigate and how to utilize the site in searching for music. Initially when you arrive to Hypem you are shown the most recent popular trending song. The site is relative simple to navigate since you can hover over tags and see what kind of music types you’d like to explore. Overall I get a happy, fun, and exciting vibe when visiting Hypem. It’s always exciting to discover new songs or music you enjoy. The site does not sell any of the songs individually and does list advertisements on the side of the page. I have personally never purchased anything from the site and use it more just play around and listen to various artists and remixes of songs I like.

			<p id="thoughts">
				 <span>Marketwatch</span> is one of my favorite site because it does a good job of providing the latest financial and business related news. I believe when you fist go to Market watch there is a sense of information overload. You first see the featured news articles and a graph of the stock market. I would describe Marketwatch as visual, cluttered, bland, and crammed. Marketwatch provides up to date financial and market news. A lot of the content are related to companies, the federal reserve, stock markets, international markets, economy, investing, and much more. 
				<br/>
   				<br/>
				I would describe the content of the website to be serious, business-oriented, ad-free, and practical. I believe this the content fits the design of the of page because a lot of people that visit Marketwatch are more about taking in as much relevant content than having an aesthetically pleasing and spaced out site. At first it may be hard to find what you are looking for since there is a lot of links and words crammed onto the webpage. Maerketwatch does do a good job to section out the site so that users can easily navigate to a section of the page they like. 
				<br/>
   				<br/>
				I feel updated, educated, and more knowledgeable about what is going on in the world after visiting Marketwatch. Marketwatch has a lot of great articles to read so one can easily get lost and spend quite some time on the website.
