          <h2>Responsive Design Overview</h2>
          <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and 
             development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on 
             screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible 
             grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user 
             switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to 
             accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, 
             the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user&#39s
             preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development 
             phase for each new gadget on the market. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

          <h2>Fluid Layouts Overview</h2>
          <p>In a fluid website layout, also referred to as a liquid layout, the majority of the components inside have percentage widths, and thus adjust to the user&#39s screen resolution.</p>
          <p>Designers may not use fluid page designs for various reasons, but the layout&#39s benefits are often overlooked. Below are pros and cons to think about when considering fluid web page design.</p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fluid web page design can be more user-friendly, because it adjusts to the user&#39s set up.</li>
            <li>The amount of extra white space is similar between all browsers and screen resolutions, which can be more visually appealing.</li>
            <li>If designed well, a fluid layout can eliminate horizontal scroll bars in smaller screen resolutions.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The designer has less control over what the user sees and may overlook problems because the layout looks fine on their specific screen resolution.</li>
            <li>Images, video and other types of content with set widths may need to be set at multiple widths to accommodate different screen resolutions.</li>
            <li>With incredibly large screen resolutions, a lack of content may create excess white space that can diminish aesthetic appeal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any designer who seeks 100% compatibility should take the time to set up a 
             fluid layout. In such a case, the main challenge isn&#39t the excess of white space 
             in large screen resolutions, but rather the small percentage of users with a small 
             screen resolution. For websites with large audiences, accommodating even the smallest 
             percentage of users may be important. But even beyond that, websites with large 
             audiences should have a simple and clean design anyway, which can be done 
             effectively with a fluid layout. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts is to accomodate different
          browsers and devices. It is good practice given the variety of
          different user agents available today. For a website to be successful,
          it should be equally usable across all platforms.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>How was it to implement these concepts?<br>It was good to finally discuss these concepts. I still feel wildly uncomfortable coding anything in pixels (as opposed to percentages, or the option to have an element "fill the parent") because I worry about different screen resolutions and sizes. I'm looking forward to learning more about these concepts.</br></li>
            <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?<br>Smartphones and tablets changed web design because they made everything tiny! No longer can the user always rely on precise clicking, key shortcuts, and reading large amounts of text at once. I think in the future web design will have default states depending on the device that is viewing it. That's sort of already the case for many things, but being able to compartmentalize the code into objects could also be helpful for making these default user interfaces for different devices.</br></li> 
            <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?<br>I would think that visually impaired people would be more likely to use computer screens as opposed to smartphones and tablets. We should indeed design and develop for them. In some ways, there are already accomodations within browsers (doing ctrl plus to zoom) or changing default text sizes on the computer. However, if we can develop such that changing the zoom doesn't screw up the formatting of the page, which it can sometimes, we absolutely should!</br></li> 
            <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?<br>The concept of responsive web design resonates with me because of personal experience. First of all, I used to have a Wordpress blog, and every time I viewed it on a phone, it looked terrible. Also, earlier in the year I got a new laptop that was higher resolution than my old one. Certain things initally appeared smaller because it was higher resolution (i.e. the pixels are closer together). That's when that concept sunk in for me. Ever since I have been aware of the need to design in a way that accomodates for different devices. Having past experience with Android programming also brought these issues to mind.</br></li>
